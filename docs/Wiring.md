Wiring the ToolChanger is not overly complicated but non-trivial. The wiring harnesses that come with the kit are extremely well labeled but the Duet 2 itself is not as easy to read the labeling. To aid in the wiring process the below diagram has been created which only calls out the connections required for the ToolChanger.

**Note:** Each callout is also labeled with small blue text that references the config, such as `P0` or `H1`. These are references to the device/heater/fan/etc identifier used for that specific connection in the [default RepRapFirmware config](Configuration.md).
